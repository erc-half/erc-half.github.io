## Mission

Tackle pivotal and long-standing open problems in harmonic analysis, and formalize their proofs in real-time at the University of Bonn.

This way, we want to show that it is feasible for authors of mathematical papers to verify the correctness of their own proofs.

Challenges in harmonic analysis:
* Find estimates for multilinear singular integrals;
<!-- prove that the triangular Hilbert form satisfies singular Brascamp-Lieb estimates -->
* Find new estimates and convergence results for Ergodic averages;
<!-- prove pointwise convergence of ergodic averages for two commuting transformations -->
* Develop nonlinear analogue of Carleson's theorem.

## News

* This project will start April 2026.
